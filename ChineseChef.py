SO, TO USE INHERITENCE(so that we can use the "chef class in this new "chinese class just by doing this")

'''

from NormalChief import normal_chief 

class ChineseChef(normal_chief):
#here we are just saying that every functions "from normal_chief" so that we can use them after imported it

#THIS IS INHERITENCE
